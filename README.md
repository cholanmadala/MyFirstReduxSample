# MyFirstReduxSample

This is a sample application which I used to learn the basics of Redux and Redux in React.

First, we need to install all the node modules we require to run this sample.

Run `npm install` and once all the node modules are installed, then run the command `npm start` to run the sample in localhost's 3000 port.
